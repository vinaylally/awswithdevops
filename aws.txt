s3 and iam are global services
we are using these commands on cmd command prompt windows
aws sts get-caller-identity
dir .. ---shows directories of previous folder
aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name cloudtrain --description "aws training"
aws stores the public key
user stores the private key ----it is with .pem extention
lsblk---it will shows how many ebs volumes attached to an instance
ebs--elastic block storage is like c drive d drive in windows
these are general purpose gp,provisioned iops io1 ,throughput optimized hdd st,cold hdd sc,magnetic
elb: elastic load balancers are 4 types 
1.classic ----path based and dns end point we are getting with this loadbalancer.in that we are giving listenrs protocalsHTTP,HTTPS, what are u adding, 
,health checks,security groups
2.application ----this lb having target groups(through instance,ip,lambda),helth checks monitering,it will shows output in round robbin method.
3.network lb
4.gateway lb
auto scaling:
auto caling is 2 types
we need to create launch template and add instances and instance types first 
then we create a auto scaling groups with cpu threshold limit increases to 60% and above then automatically increases instance.for this we are giving min,max,desired capacity of instances
1.horizontal scaling ---adding and removing instance with same configuration depends on traffic.scale out >,scale in <
2.vertical scaling---increse the resources of instance r decrese the resources (t2.micro to t2.medium) scale up >,scale down <
we need to add minimum ,desired and maximum capacity.
auto scaling is monitered by cloud watch metrics(metrics is nothing but cpu ram usage details send to cloud watch.it will notified to auto scaling) it will give u the details of instances like cpu usage and notifys to auto scaling groups
memory ----in windows we use ram 4gb 6 gb
but in aws we use instance types.that are t2.micro(1 cpu,1 gb ram ),t2.medium etc..
route 53:
it is mainly used for route the traffic to the end user with the dns name r domain name.it is also used for configure health checks,configure traffic flow and buy a domain for u r site
vpc: virtual private cloud which an aws service and it can be worked as a isolated network under the network what are the services u want u can define under this.
in the vpc we can create subnets,route tables,internet gateway,
u can select u r own ip range.in this vpc we are having flow logs for checking health and who can accessing all
nacl is a vpc level security system
subnet: basically these are 2 types 
subnets are availability zone specific
1.public subnet --internet gate way attched then it is a punlic subnet
2.private subnet ---igw not attached then it is a private subnet
route table: it will allow outside traffic.
public instance having public ip and private ip
private instance having only private ip
if u want connect with private instance we can use public intsnace from public instance to we can contact into private intsance.
with the help of both private ips
=====================================================================================================

for above purpose first copy u r pem file from local to public instance by using scp command
scp -i "c:/users/downloads/vinay.pem-pem file location" ec2-user@ec2-34-237-137-87.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/tmp
log into public instance
cd /tmp
use ssh client link of private instance but it is not connecting bcz one vpc to another vpc we need vpc peering concept so it is not connecting
we are getting connection tomed out message
=========================================================================================================================
vpc peering:
vpc peering done in same region or another regions also 

for above purpose first copy u r pem file from local to public instance by using scp command
scp -i "c:/users/downloads/vinay.pem-pem file location" ec2-user@ec2-34-237-137-87.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/tmp
log into public instance
cd /tmp
use ssh client link of private instance but it is not connecting bcz one vpc to another vpc we need vpc peering concept so it is not connecting
we are getting connection tomed out message
now in vpc section we are having vpc peering optin add accepter and receiver instances then the peering connection established.
now u used to change the route table settings.in first vpc add subnets cidr blocks in route tables by using option peering connection
then chmod 400 .pemkey
then again use the privaate key link we can connect now
====================================================================
security gruop is statefull firewall connection. here we need to edit inbound rule automatically allows in outbound rules also
nacl is stateless .we need to add rules in in bound and out bound in nacl for one port.it is subnet level
nat gateway:
it is a pert of public subnet .so we create in public subnet

s3:
bucket-object-files
once enable static website hosting it will gives you bucket website endpoint.
upload index.html,error.html
give bucket permmisions and bucket policies
aws storage gateway: it is a bridge bw onprmises data to cloud data in s3
it is 3 types
1.files
2.volume 
3.tape gateway
aws snowball:
